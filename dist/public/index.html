      <h3>Combat - Stats</h3>
      <p>
        There are quite a few stats, but don't worrys since most of them are self-explanatory. Regardless, this sections will go over them in detail:
        <br><br>
        <b>Attack</b> and <b>Magic Attack</b> dictate damage dealt by your physical and magical attacks. Similarly,
        <b>Defence</b> and <b>Magic Defence</b> dictate the amount by which incoming physical and magical attacks are reduced. <u>
        (DO NOTE that 'physical' the element (along with fire, water, etc..) and 'physical' the attack type ('physical and magical')
        are two VERY different things. Attack boosts physical damage, the ATTACK TYPE. To increase the damage of attacks with
        the physical ELEMENT, you need to increase your physical offence stat [the elemental stat]).
        </u>
        <br><br>
        <b>Speed</b> is a special stat. If your speed is at least 2x as high as your opponent's, you will gain an additional
        action on your turns!
        <br><br>
        <b>Stamina</b>, <b>Mana</b> and <b>SP</b> are used to perform certain skills. <b>Stamina</b> regenerates over time
        during a battle, whereas <b>Mana</b> does not. <b>SP</b> always starts at 0 and is usually gained through certain skill
        and item effects. Keep in mind that stamina, health and mana will not regenerate inbetween battles while exploring!
        <br><br>
        <b>Effectiveness</b> increases your chances of applying a debuff by a certain percentage. <b>Resistance</b> decreases
        your chances of applying a debuff by a certain percentage.
        <br><br>
        Your <b>Elemental stats</b> show the percentages of damage you take/deal from certain elements. 200 fire attack means
        your fire attacks deal double (200%) damage, and 50 fire defence means fire attacks dealt to you deal half (50%) damage.
        The percentage you see beside a number when an attack is used is a combination of the user's elemental offence, the
        target's elemental defence and any mitigation effects. Elemental stats cannot go below 1 or above 500.
        <br><br>
        <b>Evasion</b> refers to the percentage chance of evading an attack. This starts at 0 for a player, but can be raised using
        skills and equipment. If an attack is evaded, no damage will be taken and sometimes effects (such as debuffs) will not occur.
        Generally speaking, only attacks that deal damage can be evaded.
        <br><br>
        <b>Critical chance</b> refers to a percentage chance of dealing a <u>critical attack</u>, in which case the attack will deal
        a percentage of the original damage denoted by your <b>Critical damage</b> (original damage is 100%, so with a critical damage
        of 150%, a critical hit will cause your attack to deal 1.5x damage).
        <br><br>
        The <b>Buff limit</b> for <b>Attack, Magic Attack, Defence, Magic Defence and Speed</b> is up to 500%
        (all buffs stack additively).
        <br><br>
        There is no such cap for <b>Critical chance/damage, Resistance, Effectiveness or Evasion</b>, however they cannot go below 0. Damage dealt
        cannot be negative.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="combat-options" class="tabcontent-2">
      <h3>Combat - Options</h3>  
      <p>
        Most of the options in combat will be your skills. But there are a few besides them that need to be known:
        <br><br>
        First of all, you can use <b>Input Shortcut</b> during battle to check your options. This is strongly recommended
        as you may forget the skills that you have equipped/their exact names. Make good use of input shortcut during combat.
        <br><br>
        Input <b>Skills</b> to see the names and descriptions (which will include cost and effects) of all your skills.
        <br><br>
        Input <b>Status</b> to see all buffs and debuffs applied to your character, along with your current HP, Mana, Stamina and SP
        (however these can also be viewed via the display in the upper right)
        <br><br>
        Input <b>Enemy</b> to see all buffs and debuffs applied to the enemy, along with their HP, Mana, Stamina and SP. You may want
        to keep track of your enemies' resources to see when/if they can use certain skills, and possibly also to deduce the costs of
        some of their skills.
        <br><br>
        Input <b>Flee</b> to immediately end the battle. However if you do so, <b>it will automatically result in your loss.</b> There
        is no death penalty in TRPG, however you will return to the main menu and have to return to your position while exploring manually
        and/or redo the fight. It is recommended only to use this if your defeat is imminent.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="combat-damage" class="tabcontent-2">
      <h3>Combat - Damage</h3>  
      <p>
        Dealing damage, as you might expect, is the key to victory. When you deal damage, you will see something like this:
        <br><br>
        Pel struck the enemy! [Attack]<br>
        10 damage! (100% physical) [physical]
        <br><br>
        On the first line, <u>Pel struck the enemy!</u> is the action description of the skill. Most skills will have their own unique
        action description, but it doesn't really mean anything. In square brackets beside the action description is the name of
        the skill <u>[Attack]</u>
        <br><br>
        On the second line, <u>(100% physical)</u> shows the damage <b>type</b>, along with the percentage modifier applied to
        the damage. This is combination of your elemenal offence, the enemy's elemental defence, and their mitigation. It does
        <u>not</u> take into account critical damage or any other modifiers. If you know your elemental offence and the
        enemy's mitigation, you can use this to infer their elemental defence for that element. But it is probably best just to
        use <u>Check</u> on them.
        <br><br>
        In square brackets beside this, <u>[physical]</u> is the attack <b>element</b>. Note here how this is a PHYSICAL type attack
        of the PHYSICAL element. This means it uses the stat defence and the elemental stat physical defence. A skill
        with the line
        <br>
        <u>10 damage! (100% physical) [water]</u>
        <br>
         deals physical (type) water (element) damage, and a skill with the line 
        <br>
        <u>10 damage! (100% magical) [physical]</u>
        <br>
         deals magical (type) physical (element) damage, although this would be quite rare.
        <br>
        Damage is also coloured according to the element, but if you have something like a dark theme web extension, the colouring can be
        messed up. This will ensure you know the elements of the attacks you are struck by and use.

        <h3>Skills and SP - Disciplines</h3>
        <p>
          Skills are organised into <b>Disciplines</b>. They usually follow a specific theme or specific strategy, but the skills within can be
          mixed with other disciplines for an optimal setup. Unlocking a discipline and also unlocking each individual skill within a discipline
          will each incur a cost. Disciplines cannot be 'forgotten' like skills can, but the resources needed to unlock them are not level-locked like
          AP is for skills. Disciplines may become visible as you grow stronger or complete other tasks. Currently, there are 4 disciplines ingame.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="learning-and-forgetting-skills" class="tabcontent-2">
        <h3>Skills and SP - Learning and forgetting skills</h3>  
        <p>
          You can learn skills that are in disciplines you've unlocked in order to add them to your repertoire (you have to equip them first to use
          them in battle though). To learn a skill, use the following inputs (from the main stats menu):
          <br><br>
          'sk'/'skills' -> 'l'/'learn' -> Select the desired discipline -> Select the desired skill -> If it can be learned, you will be given
          the option to do so.
          <br><br><br>
          Most skills can also be forgotten. This will return the AP from having learned the skill, but nothing else - the gold and any reagents used
          will be lost forever. A skill must not be equipped if you are to forget it. To forget a skill, use the following inputs (from the main stats menu):
          <br><br>
          'sk'/'skills' -> 'e'/'equipped' -> Select the discipline of the skill -> 'f'/'forget' -> Confirm decision
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="equipping-and-unequipping-skills" class="tabcontent-2">
        <h3>Skills and SP - Equipping and unequipping skills</h3>  
        <p>
          After you've unlocked a skill, in order to use it in combat, you need to have it equipped. You can have up to 12 skills equipped, including
          'Attack' and 'Guard'. They cannot be unequipped, which means you can have 10 skills of your choice equipped at any one time. There is no
          restriction on the combinations of skills you can have equipped. To equip a skill, use the following inputs (from the main stats menu):
          <br><br>
          'sk'/'skills' -> 'e'/'equipped' -> Select the appropriate discipline -> Select the appropriate skill -> 'e'/'equip'
          <br><br><br>
          You can also view all your currently equipped skills. When doing so, you can type the name of an equipped skill in order to unequip it.
          To do both of these things, use the following inputs (from the main stats menu):
          <br><br>
          'sk'/'skills' -> 'e'/'equipped' -> 'e'/'equipped'
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="allocating-sp" class="tabcontent-2">
        <h3>Skills and SP - Allocating SP</h3>  
        <p>
          When you level up, all your stats increase slightly. However, you will also gain two SP, which you can use to further increase
          certain stats of your choice. The following stats can be allocated to:
          <br><br>
          Health - 20 HP per 1 SP<br>
          Mana - 15 Mana per 1 SP<br>
          Atk, Def, MAtk, MDef, Speed - 2 of each stat per 1 SP
          <br><br>
          <u>Do note that there is a limit to the amount of SP that can be allocated to one stat depending on your level. This
           is to prevent overly min-maxed builds.</u>
          <br><br>
          SP can also be reset. Specific stats cannot be un-allocated, only all allocated SP at once. This incurs a gold cost, which is
          equal to the total SP allocated * 20.
          <br><br>
          The SP menu is easy to find. To access it, just input 'sp' in the main stats menu.

          Firstly, if you just want to navigate backwards, usually 'b'/'back' will do the trick. When exploring, input 'rep'/'reprint' to
          see your options.
          <br>
          Usually, to remedy this, you can press the allocated input shortcut key. You can use the super command 'sc-inputshortcut'
           to check what your toggle for it is.
          If input shortcut is unavailable, you can try to scroll up and see if there were any instructions for the menu you're in. 
          <br><br>
          As a side note, if input shorcut won't work and 'back' won't work, you are probably exploring. So input 'rep'/'reprint' to see
          your options. You may also find that 'sc-return' brings you to a menu you can operate in.

          <b>I can't beat an enemy!</b>
          <br>
          Enemies will often have gimmicks or behaviours that, when understood make the fight significantly easier. Try to look
          for patterns such as the turns that skills are used, or the costs of some skills and when they are used. Some enemies
          will respond to your actions by using certain skills, others will use a skill whenever available, for others, it may
          be random. Watch out for <u>Boost</u> in particular; some monsters will use it whenever they have the SP.
          <br><br>
          Alternatively, try Analyzing the enemy using the skill in the Adventurer's discipline. This way you can learn of any
          potential weaknesses, and perhaps infer some things about its behaviour from your observations. You can also try and
          change your stats to suit certain enemies, for example having just enough speed to gain the extra action. Find
          the strategy that best suits you!
          <br><br>
          Also, while battling, keep in mind small plays that are slightly more efficient - they may help in the long run.
          An example is guarding when you know an enemy is going to boost. This will reduce the damage they deal boosting, and
          you can use the gained SP to boost yourself and deal additional (unguarded) damage. In this case, their use of SP
          was less efficient than yours, and this can be the difference between victory and defeat.
          <br><br><br>
          <b>I keep dying while travelling!</b>
          <br>
          It could help to learn about the enemies in the area, so you can beat them efficiently and not have to use as many
          items. Also, many floor shops (accesible in the main menu by inputting 'shop') will sell items like health and mana
          potions to help you explore more easily. You can sell enemy drops to get gold fast for potions and the like.
